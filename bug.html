I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The HTML structure appeared correct, and the Tailwind directives in my `tailwind.config.js` file seemed properly configured. However, the styles were simply not rendering.  I checked the browser's developer tools, but there were no apparent errors in the console.
